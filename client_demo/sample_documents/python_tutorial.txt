Python Programming Tutorial

Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Basic Syntax
Python uses indentation to define code blocks, making it very readable:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))

Variables and Data Types
Python supports several data types:
- Integers: whole numbers like 42
- Floats: decimal numbers like 3.14
- Strings: text like "Hello World"
- Lists: ordered collections like [1, 2, 3]
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs like {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code:

def calculate_area(radius):
    pi = 3.14159
    return pi * radius * radius

area = calculate_area(5)
print(f"The area is {area}")

Control Flow
Python supports if statements, loops, and more:

for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{i} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is odd")

Classes and Objects
Python supports object-oriented programming:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def introduce(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old"

person = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person.introduce())

Libraries and Modules
Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries:
- requests: for HTTP requests
- pandas: for data analysis
- numpy: for numerical computing
- matplotlib: for plotting and visualization

This concludes our basic Python tutorial. Happy coding!
