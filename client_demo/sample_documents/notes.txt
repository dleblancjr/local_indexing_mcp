Personal Notes - MCP Demo Content

== Configuration Notes ==
The MCP server requires a config.json file with the following structure:
- source_directory: Path to documents to index
- index_output_directory: Where to store the search index
- included_extensions: File types to include (.txt, .md, .py)
- excluded_extensions: File types to skip (.pyc, .pyo)
- scan_interval_seconds: How often to check for changes
- max_file_size_mb: Maximum file size to index

== Search Tips ==
When searching through indexed content:
1. Use specific terms for better results
2. Boolean operators work: AND, OR, NOT
3. Phrase searches use quotes: "exact phrase"
4. Case-insensitive by default
5. Stemming and fuzzy matching available

== Common Use Cases ==
- Code documentation search
- Project file organization
- Knowledge base queries
- Research note retrieval
- Configuration reference lookup

== Best Practices ==
* Keep files organized in logical directories
* Use meaningful file names
* Include descriptive comments in code
* Regular index refresh for new content
* Monitor index size and performance

== Troubleshooting ==
Problem: No search results
Solution: Check if files are in included_extensions

Problem: Slow search performance  
Solution: Reduce max_file_size_mb or optimize content

Problem: Index not updating
Solution: Force refresh or check scan_interval_seconds

== Technical Details ==
The MCP server uses SQLite FTS5 for full-text search with the following features:
- Tokenization and stemming
- Relevance scoring
- Snippet generation
- Multi-term queries
- Performance optimizations

Database schema includes:
- file_metadata table for tracking files
- search index for content lookup  
- error logging for debugging

Remember to backup index files before major changes!
